                                                By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally, 
                                                and agreed with his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on football. 
                                                However, one year later, he was <b>diagnosed with a racing heart</b>, a condition that could have forced him 
                                                to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise 
                                                multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.
                                                He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.
